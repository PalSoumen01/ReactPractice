What is the react hook?
--> A React Hook is a specialized function that allows functional components to directly 
access React features such as state and lifecycle methods. Essentially, it provides a way 
for functional components to manage their internal state and handle side effects, something
previously limited to class components. Hooks enable a more concise and reusable code 
structure, making it possible to build entire applications primarily with functional 
components.

What is reconciliation?
---> Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes 
React work faster. React uses a diffing algorithm so that component updates are predictable
and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of
DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components. React stores a copy of Browser DOM 
which is called Virtual DOM. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM
and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by the Diffing Algorithm. 
Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates
only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called 
Reconciliation.

What is the difference between useMemo and useCallback?
--> useMemo caches the return value of a function. useCallback caches the function 
definition itself.

useMemo is used when you have an expensive calculation you want to avoid on every render.
useCallback is used to cache a function to avoid re-creating it on every re-render.

useMemo makes sure that an expensive function should only be called for state values 
dependent on it.
useCallback creates stable functions that maintain the same reference between renders. 
This avoids unnecessary rendering of child components.

What is React Router?
--> React Router is a library for handling routing and navigation in React JS Applications.
It enables navigation in a single-page application (SPA) without refreshing the entire page.

What are the different types of routers in React Router v6?
i. BrowserRouter: The BrowserRouter is the most commonly used router for modern React 
    applications. It uses the HTML5 History API to manage routing, which allows the URL to be 
    dynamically updated while ensuring the browser's address bar and history are in sync.

ii. HashRouter: The HashRouter is useful when you want to use a URL hash (#) for routing, 
    rather than the HTML5 history API. It doesn't require server configuration and works even 
    if the server doesn't support URL rewriting.

iii. MemoryRouter: The MemoryRouter is used in non-browser environments, such as in React 
    Native or when running tests.
